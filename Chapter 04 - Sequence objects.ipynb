    "Chapter ‍3 introduced the sequence classes. Immediately “above” the Seq class is the Sequence Record or SeqRecord class, defined in the Bio.SeqRecord module. This class allows higher level features such as identifiers and features (as SeqFeature objects) to be associated with the sequence, and is used throughout the sequence input/output interface Bio.SeqIO described fully in Chapter ‍5.\n",

    "Sequence features are an essential part of describing a sequence. Once you get beyond the sequence itself, you need some way to organize and easily get at the more “abstract” information that is known about the sequence. While it is probably impossible to develop a general sequence feature class that will cover everything, the Biopython SeqFeature class attempts to encapsulate as much of the information about the sequence as possible. The design is heavily based on the GenBank/EMBL feature tables, so if you understand how they look, you’ll probably have an easier time grasping the structure of the Biopython classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea about each SeqFeature object is to describe a region on a parent sequence, typically a SeqRecord object. That region is described with a location object, typically a range between two positions (see Section ‍4.3.2 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SeqFeature class has a number of attributes, so first we’ll list them and their general features, and then later in the chapter work through examples to show how this applies to a real life example. The attributes of a SeqFeature are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.type` – This is a textual description of the type of feature (for instance, this will be something like ‘CDS’ or ‘gene’).\n",
    "- `.location` – The location of the SeqFeature on the sequence that you are dealing with, see Section ‍4.3.2 below. The SeqFeature delegates much of its functionality to the location object, and includes a number of shortcut attributes for properties of the location:\n",
    "    - `.ref`– shorthand for `.location.ref` – any (different) reference sequence the location is referring to. Usually just None.\n",
    "    - `.ref_db` – shorthand for `.location.ref_db` – specifies the database any identifier in .ref refers to. Usually just None.\n",
    "    - `.strand`– shorthand for `.location.strand` – the strand on the sequence that the feature is located on. For double stranded nucleotide sequence this may either be 1 for the top strand, −1 for the bottom strand, 0 if the strand is important but is unknown, or None if it doesn’t matter. This is None for proteins, or single stranded sequences.\n",
    "- `.qualifiers` – This is a Python dictionary of additional information about the feature. The key is some kind of terse one-word description of what the information contained in the value is about, and the value is the actual information.

    "So far we’ve only used simple positions. One complication in dealing with feature locations comes in the positions themselves. In biology many times things aren’t entirely certain (as much as us wet lab biologists try to make them certain!). For instance, you might do a dinucleotide priming experiment and discover that the start of mRNA transcript starts at one of two sites. This is very useful information, but the complication comes in how to represent this as a position. To help us deal with this, we have the concept of fuzzy positions. Basically there are several types of fuzzy positions, so we have five classes do deal with them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ExactPosition` – As its name suggests, this class represents a position which is specified as exact along the sequence. This is represented as just a number, and you can get the position by looking at the position attribute of the object.\n",
    "- `BeforePosition` – This class represents a fuzzy position that occurs prior to some specified site. In GenBank/EMBL notation, this is represented as something like `<13', signifying that the real position is located somewhere less than 13. To get the specified upper boundary, look at the position attribute of the object.\n",
    "- `AfterPosition` – Contrary to BeforePosition, this class represents a position that occurs after some specified site. This is represented in GenBank as `>13', and like BeforePosition, you get the boundary number by looking at the position attribute of the object.\n",
    "- `WithinPosition` – Occasionally used for GenBank/EMBL locations, this class models a position which occurs somewhere between two specified nucleotides. In GenBank/EMBL notation, this would be represented as ‘(1.5)’, to represent that the position is somewhere within the range 1 to 5. To get the information in this class you have to look at two attributes. The position attribute specifies the lower boundary of the range we are looking at, so in our example case this would be one. The extension attribute specifies the range to the higher boundary, so in this case it would be 4. So object.position is the lower boundary and object.position + object.extension is the upper boundary.\n",
    "- `OneOfPosition` – Occasionally used for GenBank/EMBL locations, this class deals with a position where several possible values exist, for instance you could use this if the start codon was unclear and there where two candidates for the start of the gene. Alternatively, that might be handled explicitly as two related gene features.\n",
    "- `UnknownPosition` – This class deals with a position of unknown location. This is not used in GenBank/EMBL, but corresponds to the ‘?’ feature coordinate used in UniProt.\n",
    "- \n",

We have a fairly simple way of representing a Reference in Biopython – we have a Bio.SeqFeature.Reference class that stores the relevant information about a reference as attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes include things that you would expect to see in a reference like journal, title and authors. Additionally, it also can hold the medline_id and pubmed_id and a comment about the reference. These are all accessed simply as attributes of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference also has a location object so that it can specify a particular location on the sequence that the reference refers to. For instance, you might have a journal that is dealing with a particular gene located on a BAC, and want to specify that it only refers to this position exactly. The location is a potentially fuzzy location, as described in section ‍4.3.2.\n",
